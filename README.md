## 🧠 FAQ

**❓ Question:** Is this safe?  
**✅ Answer:** Yes! Rias Khinsider Downloader is open source and does not contain malware, ads, or hidden network calls. Some antivirus programs may flag the executable as suspicious due to PyInstaller packaging — these are false positives.

---

**❓ Question:** Do I need cookies or login?  
**✅ Answer:** No. KHInsider provides public access to all soundtracks, so no cookies, accounts, or authentication are required.

---

**❓ Question:** Can I download FLAC?  
**✅ Answer:** Currently, only MP3 is fully supported. While the app can detect FLAC links on KHInsider pages, it prioritizes and downloads MP3 files by default.

---

**❓ Question:** Where are my downloads saved?  
**✅ Answer:** You choose the destination folder when starting a download. The app automatically creates a subfolder named after the album and saves all tracks (and album art) inside it.
